                At Olives and Thyme, we have been serving our community since
                1990. Our founder, Christos Sykas, started the business with a
                vision to provide high-quality, home-style meals to his
                customers. With his passion for cooking and a strong work ethic,
                Christos built a loyal following and the restaurant soon became
                a neighborhood favorite.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, our team of chefs and staff continue to carry on
                Christos's legacy by using only the freshest and highest-quality
                ingredients in our dishes. We believe that good food starts with
                good ingredients, and that's why we source our ingredients from
                local farms and suppliers whenever possible. We take pride in
                the quality of our food and the service we provide to our
                customers, and we look forward to serving you soon!
